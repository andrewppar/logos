* Bugs
** TODO make the host for events.clj to use into an environment variable
** TODO If quantified args are not quoted or formulas they are treated as vars this should error (or make a good interpretation of intention)

* Version 1
** TODO Fix everything in the [[Bugs]] section
** DONE All the theorems in test.logos
CLOSED: [2022-03-19 Sat 18:20]
** DONE Read formulas as strings that look the same as how a formula is serialized
CLOSED: [2022-03-19 Sat 22:05]
** TODO Support reading formulas as clojure structs and as lispy serialized forms
** TODO README
** TODO Easy Deployment [%]
*** TODO Add git checks
*** TODO Add a release process
*** TODO Figure out how to launch anywhere with a single command (this should be easy -- it's on the jvm :))
** TODO Documentation in the UI
** TODO Add a theorems pane to the UI
** TODO Remove the =theorems= and the =current-proof= atoms
** TODO Check for wrong number of premises when doing premise operation
** TODO All premise operations should happen inside a modal -- that is, we should select which premises to operate on in a modal and then submit the operation. Premise selection should still be a checkbox though
** TODO We should call format on premises and goals before we send them back to the front end
* Version 2
** TODO Support Lambdas
** TODO Formula builder
** TODO See other goals, or goals coming down the line
** TODO Support assertions in proofs and figure out what a proof with assertions means
** TODO Support using other theorem in proofs

* Future
** TODO Support model creation for failed proofs
